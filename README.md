# UCM-T

**Unified Compressible Medium Theory (UCM-T)**  
Research hub for models, calibration pipelines, and reproducible benchmarks.

This repository serves as a central coordination point for:
- theoretical models based on the Unified Compressible Medium framework,
- calibration pipelines across different physical domains,
- reproducible computational benchmarks and validation datasets.

The project is organized around the principle of **operational testability**:
any theoretical statement is meaningful only if it can be mapped to
a concrete calibration or falsification procedure.

> This repository does not enforce a fixed internal structure.
> Individual modules, engines, and datasets may evolve independently,
> provided they comply with reproducibility and documentation requirements.
