# UCM-T

**Unified Compressible Medium Theory (UCM-T)**  
Research hub for models, calibration pipelines, and reproducible benchmarks.

## Navigation

- Documentation: [`docs/`](docs/)  
  Methodological manifesto (RU/EN) and lightweight project conventions.

- Modules: [`modules/`](modules/)  
  Domain-specific workspaces (e.g., rotation curves) with reproducibility links.

  - Tools: [`tools/`](tools/)  
  Reproducibility bundle template and cross-module results contract.

This repository serves as a central coordination point for:
- theoretical models based on the Unified Compressible Medium framework,
- calibration pipelines across different physical domains,
- reproducible computational benchmarks and validation datasets.

The project is organized around the principle of **operational testability**:
any theoretical statement is meaningful only if it can be mapped to
a concrete calibration or falsification procedure.

> This repository does not enforce a fixed internal structure.
> Individual modules, engines, and datasets may evolve independently,
> provided they comply with reproducibility and documentation requirements.
