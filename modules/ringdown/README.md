# Ringdown Module

This module collects UCM-T related work on **ringdown signals** of compact objects:
models, inference pipelines, and reproducible benchmarks.

## Scope

- Operational modeling of ringdown physics within the UCM-T framework
- Parameter inference and comparative tests against public GW catalogs where applicable
- Reproducible benchmark runs and result packaging conventions

## Data policy

Large posterior samples, event archives, and full run outputs must not be committed to Git.
Use external archives (e.g., Zenodo) and provide persistent links.

## Status

Bootstrap stage.
This folder currently provides a stable entry point for future additions:
documentation, helper scripts, and links to external reproducibility bundles.

## Planned contents (non-binding)

- `links.md` — persistent links to datasets / Zenodo bundles / releases
- `runs/` — small demo artifacts only (full results archived externally)
- `tools/` — helpers specific to ringdown benchmarking and reporting
