# Ringdown — External Links

This file lists **persistent external resources** used by the ringdown module:
datasets, reproducibility bundles, benchmark archives, and related references.

> Policy: large data and full benchmark outputs are stored externally (e.g., Zenodo).
> This repository keeps only scripts, documentation, and small demo artifacts.
