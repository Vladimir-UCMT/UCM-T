# Documentation

This folder contains concise, versioned documentation for the UCM-T repository:
methodological notes, conventions, and high-level project texts.

## Core documents

- **Methodological manifesto (RU):** [manifesto_ru.md](manifesto_ru.md)
- **Methodological manifesto (EN):** [manifesto_en.md](manifesto_en.md)

## Scope

The `docs/` directory is intentionally lightweight:
- it defines principles and conventions,
- it avoids enforcing a rigid repository structure,
- it provides stable reference texts that can be cited and reused.

If you are looking for computational modules, engines, or benchmarks,
see the repository root and follow the current navigation.
