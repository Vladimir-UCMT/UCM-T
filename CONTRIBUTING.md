# Contributing to UCM-T

Thank you for your interest in the **Unified Compressible Medium Theory (UCM-T)** project.

This repository is a research hub focused on **operationally testable models**
and **reproducible calibration pipelines**. Contributions are welcome,
provided they follow the principles below.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Reproducibility first**  
   Any contribution must be reproducible by an independent user.
   Scripts, parameters, and version information must be provided.

2. **Operational testability**  
   Theoretical statements should be connected to a concrete calibration,
   benchmark, or falsification procedure whenever possible.

3. **No large binary data in Git**  
   Large datasets, simulation outputs, and binary files **must not**
   be committed directly to the repository.
   Use external storage (e.g. Zenodo) and provide links instead.

4. **Minimal assumptions about structure**  
   This repository does not enforce a fixed internal architecture.
   Modules and tools may evolve independently, as long as they are
   documented and reproducible.

## Data and Results

- Small example datasets for demonstration purposes are acceptable.
- Full datasets and benchmark results should be hosted externally
  (e.g. Zenodo) with clear versioning and persistent identifiers.
- Each computational module should clearly state:
  - input format,
  - output format,
  - required dependencies.

---

## Style and Scope

- Clarity is preferred over cleverness.
- Explicit assumptions are preferred over implicit ones.
- Negative results and limitations are welcome if clearly documented.

---

## Process

At the current stage of the project:
- Contributions are reviewed by the repository owner.
- Pull requests may be discussed or revised before merging.
- The governance model may evolve as the project grows.
